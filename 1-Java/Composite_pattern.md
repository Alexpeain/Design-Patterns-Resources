# Composite Pattern in Java
## Definition
The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets you treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In simpler terms, it's a way to create complex structures from simpler objects.

## Explanation in Simple Terms
Imagine you have a company organization chart. You have employees, and some of those employees manage other employees. In this pattern, each employee is represented as a "leaf" (a basic object) and managers as "composites" (objects that can contain other objects). You can treat individual employees and entire management hierarchies in the same way. This pattern is like building with LEGO bricks. You can use a single LEGO piece (leaf) or combine many pieces to create more complex structures (composites). It simplifies working with complex structures by treating them uniformly.

## Code Related Explanation
In this repository, we have implemented the Composite Pattern in Java. You'll find the following classes:

Component: This is the interface or abstract class that defines the common methods for both leaf and composite objects.
Leaf: This class represents the individual objects or the basic building blocks.
Composite: This class represents the composite objects that can contain other objects (composites and leaves).
Client: The client code demonstrates how to create and work with composite objects. It can treat both leaves and composites uniformly.

```
// Create leaf objects
Component developer1 = new Leaf("John");
Component developer2 = new Leaf("Alice");

// Create a composite object (a team)
Component team = new Composite("Development Team");
team.add(developer1);
team.add(developer2);

// Create another leaf
Component manager = new Leaf("Mike");

// Create a higher-level composite (a department)
Component department = new Composite("Engineering Department");
department.add(manager);
department.add(team);

// You can now treat individual employees and entire departments uniformly
department.operation(); // This will call the operation() method on all elements in the hierarchy
```
