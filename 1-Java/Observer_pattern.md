# Observer Pattern in Java
## Definition
The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. It is a widely used pattern for implementing distributed event handling systems and is a key component in many Java frameworks.

## Explanation in Simple Terms
Imagine you have a subject (or publisher) and multiple observers (or subscribers). The subject is like a news agency, and the observers are like people who have subscribed to receive news updates. When the news agency publishes a new article, it notifies all its subscribers, and each subscriber reads the article. If a new article is published, all subscribers are automatically informed and can react accordingly.

In Java terms, the Observer Pattern allows one object to inform a list of other objects (observers) about changes without them needing to know the specifics of what has changed. This promotes loose coupling and helps keep your code modular and maintainable.

Subject (Publisher)
In Java, the subject is typically implemented as an interface or an abstract class that defines the methods for registering, removing, and notifying observers. Here's a simplified example:

```
public interface Subject {
    void registerObserver(Observer observer);
    void removeObserver(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers();
}

public class NewsAgency implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private String news;

    @Override
    public void registerObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(news);
        }
    }

    public void publishNews(String news) {
        this.news = news;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}
